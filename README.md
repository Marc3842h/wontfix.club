# wontfix.club Frontend

**This project is getting deprecated. I'll be working forward to a new, improved version of wontfix.club that will be developed on the `v2` branch.**  
  
This is the frontend for wontfix.club. This site is
pretty edgy and uses a lot of jQuery. Viewer discretion
is advised.
